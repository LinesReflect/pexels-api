# Pexels API

Pexels API is a web application that takes the input of a Pexels collection ID, and in return, displays the photos inside of the collection onto the web page. This is done by using the API provided by Pexels. This is a project in The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails curriculum that focuses on the use of API's.
